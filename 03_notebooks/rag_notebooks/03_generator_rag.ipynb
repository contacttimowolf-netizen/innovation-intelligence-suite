      "\n",
      "**Advancements in Autonomous Driving Systems**\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent research has focused on developing more robust and accurate autonomous driving systems. For instance, Gaia-1 was offered for autonomous driving prediction and simulation of scenarios by Hu et al. (2023) [23] through a generative AI-driven world model [1]. Similarly, Marathe et al. (2023) [35] proposed Wedge, a novel dataset synthesized from artificial intelligence models that focus on multi-weather conditions for autonomous driving [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Simulating Difficult Driving Scenarios**\n",
      "\n",
      "Al. (2024) [59] presented the ability to simulate difficult driving scenarios, which could help polish and test autonomous driving systems under varied conditions [1]. This is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Multimodal World Models**\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent research has also focused on developing multimodal world models for autonomous driving. For example, BEVWorld: A Multimodal World Model for Autonomous Driving via Unified BEV Latent Space was proposed by Y. Zhang et al. (2024) [158]. Another example is MUVO: A Multimodal World Model with Spatial Representations for Autonomous Driving, proposed by D. Bogdoll et al. (2024) [159].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Occupancy Forecasting and Planning**\n",
      "\n",
      "Occupancy forecasting and planning are critical components of autonomous driving systems. Recent research has proposed various approaches to address these challenges. For example, Driving in the Occupancy World: Vision-Centric 4D Occupancy Forecasting and Planning via World Models for Autonomous Driving was proposed by Y. Yang et al. (2025) [160].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Path Planning and Architecture**\n",
      "\n",
      "Path planning and architecture are essential components of autonomous driving systems. Recent research has proposed various approaches to address these challenges. For example, LLM-A*: Large Language Model Enhanced Incremental Heuristic Search on Path Planning was proposed by N. Nayakanti et al. (2024) [235].
