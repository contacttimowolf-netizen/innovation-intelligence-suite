      "**Current Status of Autonomous Driving**\n",
      "\n",
      "Autonomous driving is a hot topic in society, with L2 and L3 autonomous driving systems already launched [Source: research_paper_1]. These systems have shown improved comfort and safety, with one system achieving a 100% accuracy rate and a perception time within 7.62 seconds [Source: research_paper_2].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Future Development Trends**\n",
      "\n",
      "The future of autonomous driving may involve vehicle-road collaboration and L4 unmanned delivery [Source: research_paper_1]. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as the accuracy attenuation of computer vision algorithms in extreme weather and the proportion of responsibility between car companies and users in autonomous driving accidents [Source: research_paper_1].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Patent Developments**\n",
      "\n",
      "There are ongoing patent developments in the field of autonomous driving. For example, Patent #1522, published on January 16, 2025, describes an autonomous driving system that uses a machine learning model to perform autonomous driving [Source: patents_data_1]. This system includes processing circuitry and one or more storage devices, and is configured to acquire log data related to the autonomous driving, as well as the current state of the operator and an ideal state required by the autonomous driving system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges and Unknown Risks**\n",
      "\n",
      "Autonomous driving cars bring convenience to people's lives, but also pose unknown risks. When an autonomous driving car causes a traffic accident, the existing law is difficult to determine the division of responsibility subject, and the autonomous driving system does not have the criminal subject qualification, leading to a lack of responsibility subject [Source: research_paper_3].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Market Focus and Protection Scope**\n",
      "\n",
      "The jurisdiction of Patent #1522 indicates that it is protected in the United States, which suggests that the market focus is on the US market. The kind code A1 indicates that it is a patent application with a search report, which suggests that it is still in the development stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the latest research on autonomous driving suggests that it is a rapidly developing field with ongoing patent developments and challenges to be addressed. However, the potential benefits of autonomous driving, including improved safety and convenience, make it an exciting area of research and development.\n",
