  "question": "Which technologies are likely to mature next year?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, it is challenging to determine which technologies are likely to mature next year due to the limited information on specific timelines and transition indicators. However, we can assess the current stage of some technologies mentioned and identify potential transition indicators.\n\n1. **PortPro Technologies' drayOS and drayOS Track**: As a transportation management software, PortPro Technologies is likely in the Commercialization Phase (TRL 7-9) given its description as a product designed for improving operations, saving time, and growing revenue. [Source: Automotive Startup Profiles & Tracker]\n\n2. **Advanced Nuclear Technologies**: The World Economic Forum's report on Emerging Technologies 2025 highlights Advanced Nuclear Technologies as a promising path to clean, reliable power. By 2030, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) could redefine how power is delivered. This suggests that Advanced Nuclear Technologies are in the Development Phase (TRL 5-6) and are expected to transition to the Commercialization Phase in the near future. [Source: World Economic Forum: Emerging Technologies 2025]\n\n3. **AI-led Molecular Design**: This technology was featured in the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2018 and is expected to continue its development. However, there is no specific information on its current stage or transition indicators. [Source: World Economic Forum: Emerging Technologies 2025]\n\n4. **mRNA Vaccines**: As a technology that has already been implemented in practice, mRNA vaccines are likely in the Commercialization Phase (TRL 7-9). [Source: World Economic Forum: Emerging Technologies 2025]\n\n5. **CRISPr-CAS9**: This technology was featured in the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2015 and is expected to continue its development. However, there is no specific information on its current stage or transition indicators. [Source: World Economic Forum: Emerging Technologies 2025]\n\nIn conclusion, while it is difficult to determine which technologies will mature next year, Advanced Nuclear Technologies and PortPro Technologies' drayOS and drayOS Track are likely to be in the Development Phase and Commercialization Phase, respectively. The transition indicators for these technologies suggest that they may transition to the next phase in the near future.",
