The SHAP algorithm was further used to quantify the contribution of each gene based on cell death features to the prediction of sepsis. Key PCD patterns were identified based on model evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve ROC), and their associated DEGs were obtained through intersection, followed by immune-related analysis of DEGs. The study included a total of 1507 sepsis cases and 484 controls globally, with 90 neonatal cases and 95 controls, 527 children cases and 101 controls, and 890 adult cases and 288 controls. The best model for predicting sepsis across different populations was GBM.The key PCD patterns selected by machine learning for different age groups were Pyroptosis (neonates), Ferroptosis (children), and Autophagy (adults).
