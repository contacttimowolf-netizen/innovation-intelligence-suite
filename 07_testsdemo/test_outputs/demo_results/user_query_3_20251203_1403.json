  "question": "What are the latest tech trends in development of AI agents",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, the latest tech trends in the development of AI agents include:\n\n1. **Agentic AI**: Agentic AI is an artificial intelligence system capable of independently planning and executing complex, multistep tasks. It is built on foundation models and can autonomously perform actions, communicate with one another, and adapt to new information. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n2. **General-Purpose Agent Platforms**: Developers are building AI-powered, general-purpose agent platforms that can be used for various tasks. Some companies are adding agentic capabilities to their existing platforms. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n3. **Autonomous Decision-Making and Interagent Communication**: AI agents are being developed to make autonomous decisions and communicate with each other, presenting exciting possibilities for various industries. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n4. **Hybrid Agents**: Hybrid agents combine hierarchical and sequential approaches, allowing agents to work both sequentially and in parallel. This approach is beneficial for tasks that require complex dependencies and prioritization.

[Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n6. **Agentic Virtual Coworkers**: Many industries are exploring the use of agentic virtual coworkers for various functions and roles, including procurement, supply chain management, and call center rostering. [Source: Bcg Ai Value 2025]\n\n7. **Language-Based Communication**: Agentic AI agents use language that humans can read, allowing them to describe what they're doing and be guided via feedback on their work plan. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n8. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Companies are integrating agentic AI into their existing systems, such as Google's Gemini 2.0 and OpenAI's Operator. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\nThese trends indicate a significant advancement in the development of AI agents, with a focus on autonomous decision-making, interagent communication, and robust governance frameworks.",
