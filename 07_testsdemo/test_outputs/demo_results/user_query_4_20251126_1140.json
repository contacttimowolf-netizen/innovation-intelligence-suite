  "question": "Summarize the key pain points/use cases mentioned in these sources about automotive AI.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided sources, the key pain points and use cases mentioned in the context of automotive AI are:\n\n1. **Lack of access to AI tools**: In relatively immature sectors, less than 50% of employees have access to AI tools, hindering the adoption of AI in core functions. [Source: Bcg AI Value 2025]\n\n2. **High workflow complexity**: AI agents incorporate predictive as well as GenAI, and vary enormously in terms of workflow complexity, making it challenging to implement AI in various workflows. [Source: Bcg AI Value 2025]\n\n3. **Limited use of AI in core functions**: In sectors such as airlines and telecommunications, AI's contribution to value in core functions pushes 80%, but in other sectors like chemicals, oil and gas, and machinery and automation, the shift toward AI use in core functions is still in its early stages. [Source: Bcg AI Value 2025]\n\n4. **Challenges in implementing generative AI**: The paper on \"Gen Ai In Automotive Applications Challenges And Opportunities With A Case Study On In-Vehicle Experience\" highlights the challenges in implementing generative AI in the automotive industry, including the need for innovative applications and the potential risks associated with its adoption. [Source: Gen Ai In Automotive Applications Challenges And Opportunities With A Case Study On In-Vehicle Experience]\n\n5. **Need for AI ecosystems and partnerships**: Strategic users of ecosystems are significantly more likely to adopt GenAI and agentic AI, reuse models and prompts across workflows, and generate greater value. [Source: Bcg AI Value 2025]\n\n6. **Limited use of machine learning**: Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that uses algorithms and statistical models to identify patterns in data and automatically improve performance, but its use is still limited in the automotive industry.
