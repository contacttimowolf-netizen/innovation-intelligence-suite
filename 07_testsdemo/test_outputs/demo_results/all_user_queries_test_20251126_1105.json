(2023) to synthesize artificial intelligence models that focus on multi-weather conditions for autonomous driving [Source: Gen_AI_in_automotive_applications_challenges_and_opportunities_with_a_case_study_on_in-vehicle_experience.txt].\n\n**Multimodal World Models**\n\nRecent research has focused on developing multimodal world models for autonomous driving. For example, BEVWorld, a multimodal world model for autonomous driving via unified BEV latent space, was proposed by Zhang et al. (2024) [Source: generative_AI_for_autonomous_driving_a_review.txt]. Another example is MUVO, a multimodal world model with spatial representations for autonomous driving, proposed by Bogdoll et al. (2024) [Source: generative_AI_for_autonomous_driving_a_review.txt].\n\n**Occupancy Forecasting and Planning**\n\nResearchers have also been working on developing occupancy forecasting and planning models for autonomous driving. For instance, Driving in the Occupancy World, a vision-centric 4D occupancy forecasting and planning model via world models for autonomous driving, was proposed by Yang et al. (2025) [Source: generative_AI_for_autonomous_driving_a_review.txt].\n\n**Dataset for Autonomous Driving**\n\nThe nuScenes dataset, a multimodal dataset for autonomous driving, was proposed by Caesar et al.
