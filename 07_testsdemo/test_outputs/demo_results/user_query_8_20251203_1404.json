The control system receives traffic information, including a plurality of image frames of a group of moving objects in a geographical control zone and generates a set of images frames of a first moving object of the group of moving objects based on application of a trained Neural Network (NN) model on the received traffic information. The generated set of image frames corresponds to a set of likely positions of the first moving object at a future time instant. The control system predicts the unsafe behavior of the first moving object based on the generated set of image frames and generates first control information, including an alternate route for a first vehicle in the geographical control zone based on the predicted unsafe behavior. The first vehicle is controlled based on the generated first control information.",
