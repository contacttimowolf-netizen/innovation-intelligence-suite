  "question": "Show me recent patents on AI for automotive.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, I will attempt to answer the question about recent patents on AI for automotive. However, please note that the context does not explicitly mention patent information. Nevertheless, I can provide some insights related to AI in the automotive industry and suggest potential sources for patent information.\n\nFrom the context, we know that:\n\n1. AI is being used in various fields, including automotive, and there is a growing need for new legal frameworks to deal with AI-related issues. [Source: Automotive Research Papers Database]\n2. AI is being used in self-driving cars, medical AI, and automated decision-making, which are all relevant to the automotive industry. [Source: Automotive Research Papers Database]\n\nHowever, to find recent patents on AI for automotive, we would need to consult patent databases or search engines. Some potential sources include:\n\n* The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)\n* The European Patent Office (EPO)\n* The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\n* Patent databases such as Google Patents or PatentScope\n\nUnfortunately, the provided context does not contain specific patent information. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive list of recent patents on AI for automotive.\n\nIf you would like to explore this topic further, I suggest searching patent databases or consulting patent attorneys for more information.",

      "content": "Authors: Sadia Sattar\n  Abstract: <jats:p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is spreading rapidly in society, but criminal law still mainly deals with human actions. This research looks at how AI systems challenge basic ideas in criminal law, such as intention (mens rea), action (actus reus), and causation. Unlike humans, AI can act on its own, learn from data, and sometimes cause harm without direct human control. Current laws are not fully able to handle situations where AI creates or helps in criminal acts. By studying recent cases, proposed laws, and legal theories, this research shows major gaps in existing rules. It argues that new legal frameworks are needed to deal with different levels of AI independence. Suggested solutions include shared responsibility models, stronger corporate liability, and clear rules for AI design and use. These ideas are important not only for cybercrime but also for areas like self-driving cars, medical AI, and automated decision-making</jats:p>",

      "content": "In this context, the panel recognises the recent ‘infrastructural turn’ in media and internet studies, deliberately steering away from speculative discussions about the future impacts of AI. Instead, the emphasis shifts towards a focus on the ‘mundanity and ordinariness of existing systems’. This highlights the importance of studying the foundational infrastructure, tools, and frameworks that shape AI development. Furthermore, it requires an understanding of the associated supply chains, investments, acquisitions, forms of ownership and support, control mechanisms, and the broader political economy surrounding AI. Such perspectives have been developed, for example, to study AI’s industry relations in healthcare, the global digital marketing and advertising industries, journalism, or the automotive industry.",
