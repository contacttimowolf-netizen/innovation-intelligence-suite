  "question": "Which startups work on AI for automotive?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about startups working on AI for automotive applications. However, we can make some inferences and connections.\n\nThe research paper \"Gen Ai In Automotive Applications Challenges And Opportunities With A Case Study On In-Vehicle Experience\" [Source: Gen Ai In Automotive Applications Challenges And Opportunities With A Case Study On In-Vehicle Experience] discusses the impact of generative AI on the automotive industry, focusing on its applications, benefits, and potential challenges. This paper explores the use of generative AI technologies like GANs and VAEs in various aspects of automotive design, manufacturing, and autonomous driving.\n\nAlthough there is no direct mention of startups working on AI for automotive, the paper's focus on generative AI and its applications in the automotive industry suggests that there may be startups working on related projects.\n\nHowever, without explicit information about startups working on AI for automotive, we cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the question.\n\nIf we look at the startups mentioned in the context, none of them are directly related to AI for automotive applications. Boxure, StartupsFM, Web Espy, Silver Tongue, Bus Rush, and VOLK are mentioned, but their descriptions do not indicate any connection to AI for automotive.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, we cannot conclusively answer the question about which startups work on AI for automotive.",
