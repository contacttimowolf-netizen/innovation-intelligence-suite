  "question": "Which AI research topics are growing fastest?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, it appears that there is limited information on AI research topics. However, we can infer some insights from the reports on future-built companies and technology trends.\n\nFrom the BCG report, \"Build for the Future 2025 Global Study,\" we can see that future-built companies are more likely to have appointed a chief AI officer and have a higher maturity in implementing responsible AI guardrails and governance. This suggests that companies are recognizing the importance of AI and are investing in the necessary infrastructure to support its development and implementation.\n\nThe McKinsey report, \"Technology Trends Outlook 2025,\" highlights several challenges and concerns related to AI, including cybersecurity and privacy concerns, ethical concerns about data governance, and sustainability issues. However, it does not provide information on specific AI research topics.\n\nGiven the limited information on AI research topics, it is difficult to determine which topics are growing fastest. However, we can infer that companies are increasingly investing in AI research and development, and that there is a growing need for responsible AI governance and sustainability.\n\nTherefore, some potential AI research topics that may be growing in importance include:\n\n1. Responsible AI governance: As companies recognize the importance of AI, they are also recognizing the need for responsible AI governance to ensure that AI systems are developed and implemented in a way that is fair, transparent, and accountable. [Source: BCG Build for the Future 2025 Global Study]\n2. AI sustainability: As AI systems require increasing computational resources, there is a growing need to address the environmental impact of AI development and deployment. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n3. Explainability and transparency: As AI systems become more complex, there is a growing need for explainability and transparency in AI decision-making processes. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n4. AI ethics: As AI systems raise ethical concerns about data governance, justice, and fairness, there is a growing need for research on AI ethics and the development of AI systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\nIt is worth noting that these topics are not necessarily \"growing fastest\" in terms of research, but rather are becoming increasingly important as companies and leaders recognize the need for responsible AI development and implementation.",
