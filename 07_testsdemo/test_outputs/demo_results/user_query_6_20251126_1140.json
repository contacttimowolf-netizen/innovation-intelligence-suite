  "question": "Which technologies are likely to mature next year?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, it is challenging to determine which technologies are likely to mature next year with high accuracy. However, we can assess the current development stage and transition indicators of the mentioned technologies.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\n\nAccording to the McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025, AI is an overarching category that has replaced four previous trends. This suggests that AI is a mature technology with a significant presence in the market. However, the report also mentions that the selection and definition of trends have been updated to reflect the evolution of technology trends, indicating that AI is still evolving.\n\nSource: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025\n\n**Future of Energy and Sustainability Technologies**\n\nThis trend combines electrification and renewables and climate technologies beyond electrification. The report mentions that the data sources and keywords have been updated, suggesting that this trend is still in the development phase.\n\nSource: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025\n\n**Emerging Technologies of 2025**\n\nThe World Economic Forum's Emerging Technologies 2025 report highlights 10 emerging technologies, including:\n\n1. **Extended Reality**: This technology is already being used in various industries, such as gaming and education. It is likely to mature in the near term.\n2. **Quantum Computing**: This technology is still in the research phase, with significant breakthroughs expected in the next few years.\n3. **Synthetic Biology**: This technology is still in the development phase, with significant investments being made in the field.\n4. **Autonomous Systems**: This technology is already being used in various industries, such as transportation and logistics. It is likely to mature in the near term.\n5. **Internet of Bodies (IoB)**: This technology is still in the research phase, with significant breakthroughs expected in the next few years.\n6. **Digital Identity**: This technology is already being used in various industries, such as finance and healthcare. It is likely to mature in the near term.\n7. **Climate Engineering**: This technology is still in the development phase, with significant investments being made in the field.\n8. **Advanced Nuclear Power**: This technology is still in the development phase, with significant investments being made in the field.\n9. **Personalized Medicine**: This technology is already being used in various industries, such as healthcare and biotechnology. It is likely to mature in the near term.\n10. **Space Technologies**: This technology is still in the research phase, with significant breakthroughs expected in the",
