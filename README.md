# innovation-intelligence-suite
A capstone project integrating two modular deliverables into one showcase: RAG interface answering domain-scoped innovation queries. And a tech adoption readiness predictor (classifies technologies into low/med/high readiness and feeds tags to RAG). Both wrapped in a single demo narrative: “How AI can accelerate insight generation for R&amp;D teams.”
